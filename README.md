# scrollsend
quick few lines of code made to make my life a teeny bit easier by using javascript to send data to css variables. 
## how to use
its pretty easy just go to css-send.js and copy paste the javascript into your file. its pretty simple just sends scroll data to css variables

if you want to use units with the numbers just multiply in a calc function, so like if you want the scroll value to affect width in px of a div be like `width: calc(var(--scroll) * 1px);` and it works. err yeah might add like seven more values later onclick values but yeah
